Bugs and Feature Requests
=========================

Tracker
-------

The Pulp project uses redmine to track all of our issues, including bugs, feature requests, and
tasks.

Projects
********

Pulp's redmine tracker is divided into "Projects". Plugin writers are invited to use our infrastructure to host their tracker as a project within
Pulp's redmine instance, but each plugin is free to host their own tracker of their choice. Please
see TODO(link, Plugin table) for a complete list of Plugin trackers, including the ones that aren't
a project under pulp.plan.io.
