Pulp Documentation
==================

The documentation presented here is generalized to all content types. Information for managing each
content type is provided by the corresponding plugin.  TODO(link, plugin table)

Self-Guided Tour for New Users
------------------------------

A good place for new users to start is with TODO(link, overview/concepts), which gives a high level
introduction to Pulp concepts and terminology. After following our TODO(link, installation) docs,
the simplest way to get concrete experience is to install a plugin and use its quickstart. From there,
see our TODO(link,Workflows) to find best practices for common use cases. From there, users should
explore the reference documentation, particularly the TODO(link, CLI ref).
