Pulp Documentation

Documentation architecture reflects the recommended linear progression for each of our audiences:
(1) Users
(2) Plugin Writers
(3) Pulpcore contributors

The documentation contains 3 types of documents:
(1) Guides: Guides are introductory materials and have relatively little prerequisite knowledge.
Guides focus on high level concepts and practical use.
(2) Reference Material: Reference material is mostly autogenerated and should be used to fully
understand all the details of specific actions.
(3) Topics: In depth explanations of complex concepts, these areas assume that the audience has
read the relevant introductory material, though expected knowledge should be explicitly stated.

For each audience, there are "entry points" that are the start of a linear flow through all the
information that the user would need for a particular topic.

Entry Points:

1) Users
   0) Prospective user evaluation
      root index -> overview(why) -> overview concepts -> plugin docs

   1) New user quickstart
      root index (here) -> installation -> plugin installation -> plugin quickstart

   2) Intermediate user designing their workflow
      Overview -> Concepts -> Workflows -> CLI guide -> Plugin Guides

   3) Advanced User tweaking their workflow
      Workflows -> CLI guide -> REST API reference -> Plugin Topics -> bugs-feature -> contributing
      docs

   4) User with problems
      guide/topic -> bugs-features

   5) User with a feature request
      Overview -> bugs-features

2) Plugin Writer
   Overview -> plugins -> plugin-writer-guide -> plugin template quickstart -> plugin-api -> rest api ->
   contributing/architecture -> bugs-features

3) Integrator (REST API consumer)
   Overview -> workflows -> integration guide

4) pulpcore contributors
   overview -> contributing/dev-setup -> contributing/pull-request-walkthrough ->
   contributing/architecture -> internal PUPs -> style guide
