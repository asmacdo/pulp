Pulp Documentation
==================

The documentation presented here is generalized to all content types. Information for managing each
content type is provided by the corresponding plugin, which can be found in our list of
:ref:`plugin-table`.

Self-Guided Tour for New Users
------------------------------

A good place for new users to start is the :doc:`overview/index`, which gives a high level
introduction to Pulp concepts, terminology, and components. After :doc:`installing
pulp<installation/index>`, the simplest way to get concrete experience is to install one of the
:ref:`plugins<plugin-table>` and use its quickstart guide. Next it is recommended that users read
through our :doc:`workflows/index` to find best practices for common use cases. From there, users
should explore the :doc:`cli-guide/index` and our reference documentation.
