    Exactly what is versioned in the Plugin API, and how, still has yet to be determined.
    This documentation will be updated to clearly identify what guarantees come with the
    semantic versioning of the Plugin API in the future. As our initial plugins are under
    development prior to the release of Pulp 3.0, the Plugin API can be assumed to have
    semantic major version 0, indicating it is unstable and still being developed.
